# Chess-LLMS
This project evaluates Google Gemini 1.5 Flash against the Stockfish chess engine to explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strategic reasoning or merely imitate patterns. Using 9M+ PGN games, it measures move quality, analyzes deviations from optimal play, and visualizes insights into AI decision-making.
